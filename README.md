# WizCLI Installation Guide

WizCLI is a command-line interface for managing your cloud resources effectively. This README provides step-by-step instructions for installing WizCLI on different platforms. The wizcli binary will also be moved to a directory accessible in each platform's PATH, meaning that wizcli can be run from any directory. Running the same script on any platform will also update the WizCli application.
